# Epilepsy classifications

Seizure is an event, and if it repeats over time, then it is epilepsy. 
Different drugs treat different types of seizures.

Status epilepticus - it is a prolonged, 
either focal seizure where eventually you loose consciousness, 
or generalized seizure that lasts for more then 5 minutes,
or repeated seizures withing short amount of time without full recovery.

## Focal

Where there is a particular area agitated. Depending on the area it manifests in different types of seizure (spasms or strange localized sensations or loss of sensation). 
Seizures can result in both loss of consciousness and no loss of consciousness.
Focal seizures can progress and result in a generalized (tonic-clonic) seizure. 

## Generalized

Where are multiple areas are agitated. Usually comes with loss of consciousness and no memory of the event.

### Types of generalized seizures

- Tonic-clonic - when muscles convulse repeatedly and with increased strength. 
- Tonic - when muscles tense up.
- Clonic - when muscles convulse repeatedly.
- Atonic - when you go limp.
- Myoclonic - quick jerky rapid type of movements.
- Absence - when you stare and zone out, usually don't remember what was going on.

## Epileptic Spasms

We don't know the mechanism of how this happens in particular. 

### Types of epileptic spasms

- Benign Rolandic spasms -
- West syndrome -
- Lennux-Gastaut syndrome - multiple seizures every day, almost impossible to control.

# Causes of epilepsy

- Vascular - if there is some type of bleeding in affected area leading to irritable part of the brain.
- Infectious - caused by something like meningitis (inflammation of the tissue surrounding the brain) or encephalitis (inflammation of the active tissues of the brain caused by an infection or an autoimmune response).
- Trauma - with bleeding towards affected area creating irritable section.
- Autoimmune - like SLE that causes antibodies to attack part of brain tissue, creating inflammation. Or cancer also creating antibodies that also irritate the brain tissue.
- Metabolic - **quite common**, high or low glucose, hyponatremia (occurs when the concentration of sodium in your blood is abnormally low). Thyroid disorders or liver disorders are also common causes.
- Idiopathic - we don't really know why, and they tend to result in epileptic types of seizures.
- Neoplasia - caused by some type of mass or lesion that spread from somewhere else.
TODO: fill out the list of toxins known to cause epilepsy.
- Drugs/toxins - allegedly very very long list.
- Eclampsia - pregnant patient.

# Mechanism of epilepsy

Two particular reason for problematic signals leading to seizures:

- Too much glutamate (_excitatory neurotransmitter with several types of receptors found throughout the central nervous system_) 
activity.
Problematic neuron(s) send action-potential over
axons(_portion of a nerve cell that carries nerve impulses away from the cell body_)
that result in generate problematic
signal(_seizure activity_).
This problematic neuron is influenced by other neurons.
Axons have voltage gated sodium channels.
When they become active,
sodium will rush into the cell making the axon positive - referred to as **depolarization**.
Depolarization activates another channel - voltage gated calcium channels let in calcium when activated.
Calcium binds to proteins called vesicles and helps it bond the cell membrane and release the glutamate.
Glutamate then binds to receptors on other nerve cells causing sodium and calcium to go into the cell.
Increased concentration of positive calcium and sodium ions in the nerve cells cause the action potential to increase
and by that cause the seizure causing signal to proliferate.

- Low or decreased GABA(Gamma-aminobutyric acid) activity.
GABAergic neuron releases GABA when activated.
It is also triggered by action potential signal transmitted over axion, 
but there is no known special channel that are relevant for this action potential.
GABA then binds to GABAa receptor protein on the membrane of other nerve cells.
GABAa receptor open a channel into the neuron for chloride ions.
Chloride ions counteract positive calcium/chloride ions and in effect reduces action potential in the nerve cell. 
So when there is a dysfunction of GAMAa receptor, you get less inhibition of actoin potential mitigations, 
resulting in stimulation of action potential, that can proliferate further, resulting in a seizure.
GABA after getting released is recycled.
  - This could also be caused by increase in GABA reuptake, reducing its concentration in the affected area. 
  - GABA can also be metabolized, resulting in reduced overall GABA levels. 

Drugs target different mechanisms used in the process of both glutamate and GABA cycles.

# Medications

treat the underlying cause. Then you might not need anti-epileptic drug.

Process of picking out the drugs is trial and error, until you get to the proper dose and seizures stop and there are no adverse side effects.
You can not abruptly stop using the drugs. Even if it is ineffective, it has to be tapered off.
